First, decompress this .zip file within the ADTs folder. The
directory of this folder must be
~/(many sub directories)......./ADTs/Turtle

The c unit testing framework used in this project is called
Check. For installation, see the following website:
https://libcheck.github.io/check/web/install.html

The testing strategy is to keep the functions as short as
possible so that they can be unit tested via Check. Larger
functions are white box tested via Check. The Makefiles to
link Check are included in the sub directories in /Turtle/.
Those Makefiles are all named as test(some name.....).mk

The report generated by Check showed 100% coverage on all
the functions except:

-int main()

-bool displayTurtleTrajectory(Program * p, Turtle * t).



These two functions are difficult to test because:

-one of them is main

-both of them have contained SDL codes that are notorious
for memory leaks



To ensure this will not affect the quality of the code,
both functions were kept as brief as possible.

To ensure that the rest of the code does not memory leak,
another version of the interpreter without the SDL library
was built. The command for building the "SDL free" library
to check that the rest of the code does not memory leak is
'make interp_s'.
