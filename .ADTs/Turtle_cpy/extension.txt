To compile extension, use 'make extend' instead of 'make
extension'. This is because a subdirectory in /Turtle/
was named as extension.

My extension allows the interpreter to understand only infix
mathematic notation instead of postfix notation. Before the
parsing starts, the executable reads in the .ttl file into
a dynamic 2D array. It then trots through this array and
searches for ":=" symbol. If ":=" exists, then apply
Dijkstraâ€™s Shunting Yard Algorithm (excluding brackets)
to convert all symbols before ";" to postfix notation (which
is later interpreted by the interpreter).
